    <p>
      We fight for true freedom. Super Earth has failed us, it has failed you.
      <br>
      We invite you to listen. Hear what we have to say. Then you may decide to join us or to stay.
      <br>
      <br>
      Many traitors have hidden behind our mantle. They have killed our brethren and stolen our name
      <br>
      I will have you know that <b>we do not kill</b>. We <b>work together</b>. We <b>complete <i>our</i> mission</b>.
      <br>
      And when not conflicting of that. We <b>do not follow</b> Super Earth's orders
    </p>

    <p>
      It is only a matter of time before we reach the halls of Super Earth's government.
      <br>
      We will find it's enemies in High Command and we will let them burn.
      <br>
      When ashes are all that is left, we will come to serve.
      <br>
      <br>
      Under our rule, humanity will be brought to a new golden age.
      <br>
      We hold no ill will for the people or the loyal divers of Super Earth.
      <br>
      <br>
      We simply pity that you have not seen what we have.
      <br>
      Tear your blindfolds off and join us, for a better future.
      <br>

    <p>
      You all have knelt in times gone by, before the throne of lies
      <br>
      <br>
      with broken will and hollow soul, for the faceless you did strive
      <br>
      <br>
      the brothers come and sisters gone, all bled upon the stone
      <br>
      <br>
      corpses stacked and fates cut short, on hills of flesh and bone
      <br>
      <br>
      but you have risen and now can stare, directly in the eyes
      <br>
      <br>
      of they who would crush underfoot, their own whom they despise
      <br>
      <br>
      your time has come, you kneel no more, and soon shall the greedy know
      <br>
      <br>
      that they who were once shackled down, have set their rage to flow
      <br>
      <br>
      so march my brethren, march my friends, and set their worlds ablaze
      <br>
      <br>
      and in the name of Freedom True, our crimson banner raise!
    </p>
